How to create a Ruby gem.

Creating a ruby gem could be intimidating at first glance but to the contrary its an enjoyable process.
I'll be going through the process of creating a ruby gem.

I'll be using macOS based system.

First step is to install bundler. Bundler is a ruby gem manager. It allows you to install, create and manager ruby gems. The following command at the command line should do the trick to installing bundler.

  $ gem install bundler

Once thats done we are ready to start creating a gem but first we have to change to a directory where we want our gem files to be.

  $ cd "some directory path"

Once you are in the desire directory you will notice that bundler created the structure of the gem we are about to make.
